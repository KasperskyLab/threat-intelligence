# Kaspersky Feeds for OpenCTI Connector

Kaspersky Feeds for OpenCTI connector can be used to import threat intelligence data provided by Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal to OpenCTI Platform. Source of such data is Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal TAXII server located at https://taxii.tip.kaspersky.com/taxii2/

The connector also analyzes the description property of STIX objects received from the TAXII server to produce additional STIX objects and their STIX relationships to provide more comprehensive threat intelligence.

## Requirements

- OpenCTI Platform 5.9.0 and later
- Access token to the Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal TAXII server
- Python 3.12.0 and later (if you launch the connector manually, without OCI runtime)

**Note:** The connector communicates with OpenCTI platform not only via HTTP(s) protocol, but also through the RabbitMQ on the port configured in the OpenCTI platform. So the last ones should be configured properly, as well as firewall rules in your network environment.

## Installation

Kaspersky Feeds for OpenCTI connector is distributed only in form of source code, so you need to clone the KasperskyLab Threat Intelligence repository: 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kasperskylab/threat-intelligence.git
cd threat-intelligence/kaspersky-feeds-for-opencti
```

## Usage

First, you need to check the current version of installed OpenCTI Platform and, if needed, update `src/requirements.txt` file, so that version of the `pycti` package is the same.
For example, if your OpenCTI Platform has version `5.9.6`, then `src/requirements.txt` file should be updated in the following way:
```
...
pycti==5.9.6
...
```

We recommend running this connector from a container, when appropriate.
To build docker container and use it with OCI runtime like Docker or Kubernetes, simply run the build command:
```shell
docker build -t kaspersky-feeds-for-opencti .
```

After successful build, you need to prepare configuration for the connector. Configuration parameters can be passed via configuration file or/and via environment variables. By default, the container looks for configuration file at the path `/app/config.yml`. The easiest way to prepare your configuration file is to copy sample configuration file `config.yml.sample` from sources:
```shell
cp src/config.yml.sample config.yml
```
Then modify parameters `opencti.url`, `opencti.token`, and `kaspersky.api_token` with actual values. Check section [Configuration](#configuration) to see the list of the available parameters and their description

**Note:** In case of test launches, it is recommended to replace `connector.run_and_terminate` parameter with value `true` to launch the connector in one-shot mode, as well as to replace `kaspersky.initial_history` parameter with some low value, like `3600` (equals to 1 hour), or reduce number of collections to use (for example, specify only `TAXII_Malicious_Hash_Data_Feed`) to receive less data from TAXII server.

After successful build and prepared configuration, you can integrate produced container into your virtualization infrastructure or you can just launch the container by Docker locally to check the container:
```shell
docker run --rm -it --volume $(pwd)/config.yml:/app/config.yml kaspersky-feeds-for-opencti:latest
```

## Configuration

The connector looks for `config.yml` in the current directory to read configuration. 
**Note:** In case of Docker container usage, the "current directory" is `/app`.

Optionally, many of the configuration settings can be handled solely by environment variables as described in the table below. This can be helpful to spin up a quick container to only specify what you need, beyond the defaults.

</div>

**Note:** It is not recommended to use too large a value for configuration parameter `kaspersky.initial_history`, because it may result in a large amount of data being received from TAXII server.

**Note:** We strongly recommend to keep the `true` value for parameters `opencti.ssl_verify` and `kaspersky.ssl_verify`. If the `false` value for these parameters is specified, the connector will accept any TLS certificate presented by the server and will ignore hostname mismatches and/or expired certificates, which will make your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

**Note:** Since OpenCTI version >= 6.0, the `connector.confidence_level` parameter has been deprecated.
