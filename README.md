# Threat Intelligence

The project is an open repository dedicated to deliver a comprehensive set of tools for integration and convenient use of Kaspersky Threat Intelligence services. Serving as a foundational hub, our repository streamlines the assimilation of diverse Kaspersky Threat Intelligence and community-driven insights. Evolving over time, our objective is to expand the suite of tools, integrating additional connectors to enhance compatibility with a broader array of software solutions. This strategic approach aims to boost the efficiency of cybersecurity operations and enable organizations to stay ahead in the face of the rapidly changing threat landscape.
